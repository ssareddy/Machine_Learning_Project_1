Code Setup Instructions

1. Download necessary datasets
    a. Health Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction
    b. Apple Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/apple-quality?resource=download

2. At the same level as project_code.py create directory called classification_dataset

3. Copy and paste .csv files from downloaded datasets and place in classification_dataset

4. Next, do pip install -r requirements.txt
    a. This will install the python packages necessary for the code to run if they do not already exist

5. Run project_code.py, when running, the code will create another directory called outputs
    a. In outputs, all plots will be generated and placed
